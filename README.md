## Introduction

In thisproject,I created a full Realtime Chat Application. We're going to use  React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 

By that, I feel a strong understanding of how to send and receive messages using web sockets and Socket.io to make any real-time application.



Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
